# Warehouse_System

The Stock Infinite Warehouse System is developed for the TechStack groupâ€™s central warehouse called Stock Infinite, which supplies inventory to multiple retail branches. The users of this system are divided into 3 roles: Warehouse Manager, Warehouse Staff, and Admin. Each user type has distinct access levels and responsibilities, addressed through a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) structure.
